PHP Instagram Implementation
============================

This directory is a prototype of how to set up your instagram grid library to work with a locally available version of your instagram data. `get-instagram.php` uses your API keys from `config.php` to run a `curl` request to the Instagram Server and return the data as a readable JSON object for the instagram grid library.
